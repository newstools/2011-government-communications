Cabinet noted that both President Zuma and Deputy President Motlanthe will officiate at the World AIDS Day under the theme: South Africa is taking responsibility on a PATH to eliminating the TB and HIV epidemics . This annual event will be held in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. It is significant to note that this World Aids Day on 1 December 2011 marks 30 years of existence of HIV/AIDS in the country. During the 2011 World Aids Day Campaign, emphasis will be on providing universal access to HIV, STIs and TB prevention, treatment, care and support. This is complementary to the global theme as South Africa will continuously strive to achieve zero HIV infections.The Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe on this occasion will also launch the South African National Strategic Plan (NSP) which provides goals and strategies for the country s response to the three diseases (HIV, STIs and TB) during the period 2012 to 2016.Cabinet wishes to express its full support for National Treasury s response to Moody s alterations on its outlook of SA s rating.

The South African government will continue to prioritize higher economic growth, job creation and reduction of property.As matriculants conclude their exams, Cabinet calls on parents, guardians, principals, teachers and communities to assist Grade 12 learners to use this time to actively plan and prepare for the future and explore all opportunities that are open to the learners whether in higher or further education institutions.On 11 November 2011, President Zuma received that National Development Plan from the National Planning Commission.

This committee was established by the Ministry of Health in October 2010 to improve the quality and integrity of data on health outcomes, establish consensus on indicator values and identify reliable data sources to be used by the health sector. The committee concluded on the following:Cabinet resolved that beyond the improvement of data quality, it is imperative that all government departments that are signatories to the Negotiated Service Delivery Agreement (NSDA) 2010-2014 continue to work together to address cross-cutting issues. These include increasing life expectancy, combating HIV and AIDS and TB and improving maternal and child health. This will require better collaboration and coordination.

Following the approval these coins will be promulgated in a Government Gazette.Cabinet noted the discontinuation of production of the South African 5c denomination coin and the replacement of the current 10c denomination coin with a new 10c denomination coin with effect from 1 April 2012.

This will result in the reduction in cost of producing these coins.Cabinet approved the final National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD1) 2011-2014 and the action plan for implementation. The aim of the NSSD1 is to direct the development path towards sustainability; change behaviour, values and attitudes; and effective governance system and build capacity. The National Framework for Sustainable Development (July 2008) signalled a new wave of thinking aimed at promoting effective stewardship of our social and economic resources. The NSSD1 builds on the NFSD and a number of initiatives that government, businesses, NGOs, civil society, academia and other role players have put in place to address sustainability issues in South Africa. The strategy calls for an interdependency approach across sectors as well as action on sustainability. In the main, this assessment is three fold: firstly, to ensure the judiciary conforms to the transformation mandate as envisaged in the Constitution of the Republic in terms of non-racialism, gender, disability and other transformational variables. Secondly, access to justice on all levels of the courts from lower courts through to Constitutional Courts. Thirdly, to affirm the independence of the judiciary as well as that of the executive and parliament with a view to promoting interdependence and interface that is necessary to realize transformation goals envisaged by the Constitution.Cabinet agreed to the following approach to the transformation of the judicial system:Measures be taken to enhance the efficiency and the integrity of the Judicial Service Commission and the Magistrates Commission in the execution of their Constitutional mandate of facilitating the racial, gender and other Constitutional prescripts in the judiciary.Cabinet approved the South African position that while the African Court of Justice and Human and People s Rights is being institutionalised to progressively achieve the realisation of extending its jurisdiction to cover international crimes which include core crimes (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes of aggression), the court should adopt an incremental approach and focus on building its capacity fully to realise its mandate.Cabinet noted the approach relating to the restructuring of State Legal Services broadly and the immediate and medium term interventions that will be undertaken within the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. The need for this restructuring has arisen out of a critical analysis of how the State is serviced by various State components and units rendering legal services. The end result envisaged from the restructuring is a unified, development-driven public sector legal practice that is founded on a vision underpinned by principles espoused in the Constitution.Cabinet noted progress made in responding to immigration challenges in South Africa. The project plan covers following areas:Cabinet noted the overall performance of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) over the past year.The President has placed a significant amount of trust in the SIU to conduct a large number of investigations into allegations of corruption and maladministration involving public funds.

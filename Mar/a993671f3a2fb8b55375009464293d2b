Cabinet held its ordinary meeting in Pretoria, on 30 March 2011.1. Decisions 1.1 The South African government is deeply concerned about deteriorating political and humanitarian situation in Libya. According to United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) about two thousands (2000) people daily cross the Libyan border to the neighbouring countries while thousands of migrant workers remain trapped inside conflict zones. We are also concerned about report of increased proliferation of arms in that region.South Africa supports the people of Libya in their quest for peace, democratic reforms, justice, human right's culture, and socio-economic development that responds to their needs.We commend the African Union Peace and Security Committee (AU PSC) for establishment of a High Level Committee on Libya because currently it is the only viable solution peaceful resolution of the crisis in a manner that responds to the legitimate needs of the Libyan people. We reiterate the call by the AU for immediate ceasefire, cooperation by Libyan Authorities to facilitate humanitarian assistance, protection of foreign nationals including African migrant workers, and the adoption of political reforms to address the root cause of the conflict.We commend the roadmap of the AU HLC, which includes:As South Africa we say no to the killing of civilians, no to the regime change doctrine and no to the foreign occupation of Libya or any other sovereign state. The South African government calls for restraint to avoid any further civilian casualties and categorically rejects any efforts of using the current crisis in Libya to effect regime change while recognising the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people for democracy and reform.We are confident that this is consistent with the African Union Peace and Security Council decision to respect the unity and territorial integrity of Libya as well as its rejection of any foreign military intervention; whatever its form .South Africa will continue to work through this Council, the AU and other multilateral as well as bilateral platforms to contribute towards a speedy resolution of the Libyan crisis in a manner consistent with the aspirations of the people of the Libya.1.2 Cabinet noted and respects the constitutional court judgment delivered on 17 March 2011 in the Glenister application involving the independence of the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation, commonly known as the Hawks.

3 October 2011 This alert is to inform media that the UNFCCC secretariat will be introducing a new, fully online media accreditation and registration system. This system will allow each individual seeking media accreditation to create a personal account, enter personal data and upload required documentation. Status information on the requested accreditation will also be available through the system. The secretariat has targeted the date of Thursday, 6 October 2011 to launch the new system. Once the system is launched, online accreditation will be the official channel to obtain registration for the media for a conference or event. The secretariat will not accept accreditations via any other channel. Please do not submit any accreditation requests for COP 17 prior to 6 October. Any forms or supporting documents already submitted for Durban will not be stored and applicants will have to resend them once accreditation for COP 17 opens. Further information will be provided.
